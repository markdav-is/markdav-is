My professional path follows two parallel tracks.  On one hand, I’m an engineer.  I’ve been doing full-stack development for over a decade and now I focus on cloud and mobile.  On the other hand, I’m a people connector and enjoy providing leadership.  Below are links to two resumes depending on what facets of mine you’d like to leverage.  I also dabble in things like hackathons and IoT projects.

This page was last updated in the winter of 2018.  I’m just wrapping up a year as the Developer Evangelist for [CBT Nuggets](http://cbtnuggets.com).  I’m actively planning [Eugene’s first open-source conference](http://openeugene.org) while leading some projects for [Dark Matter](http://darkmatter.consulting) and managing a [coworking space](http://codechops.com).  I put this page together to [link](http://markdav.is) with some new business cards.

Here's a photo of me presenting at an [AT&T developers conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=rwDRFM2hcsY&t=314) a few years ago.

Welcome to my business card!  I'm glad you're here! :tada:

I'm obsessed with collaboration.  The more folks on a project the better, and we all learn from each other to bring the awesome.

If you want to connect, the best way is to chat me up in [The Slack](http://eugenetech.slack.com) or maybe use [The Switchboard](http://eugenetech.switchboardhq.com) or you can find me on social media via [Instagram](http://instagram.com/markedavis) or [Tumblr](https://markdav-is.tumblr.com/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MarkTheDavis) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nohorse) so many ways to collaborate.

My professional path follows a few tracks.  On one hand, I’m an software engineer.  I’ve been doing full-stack development for over a decade and now I focus on cloud and mobile.  On the other hand, I’m a people connector and enjoy providing leadership.  Below are links to two resumes depending on what facets of mine you’d like to leverage.  I also dabble in things like [hackathons](http://openeugene.org) and [large scale art projects](http://king-pong.com)

This page was last updated in the Summer of 2018.  I’m currently on contrat with the [HP Developer Program Team](http://hp.io) and managing a [coworking space](http://codechops.com).  I put this page together to [link](http://markdav.is) for my business cards.

Here's a photo of me presenting at an [AT&T developers conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=rwDRFM2hcsY&t=314) a few years ago.

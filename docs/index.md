My professional path follows two parallel tracks.  On one hand, I’m an engineer.  I’ve been doing full-stack development for over a decade and now I focus on cloud and mobile.  On the other hand, I’m a people connector and enjoy providing leadership.  Below are links to two resumes depending on what facets of mine you’d like to leverage.  I also dabble in things like hackathons and IoT projects.

This page was last updated in the winter of 2018.  I’m just wrapping up a year as the Developer Evangelist for CBT Nuggets.  I’m actively planning Eugene’s first open-source conference while leading some projects for Dark Matter and managing a coworking space.  I put this page together to go with some new business cards.  Think of it as the online edition.

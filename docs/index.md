## Welcome to my business card! ðŸŽ‰

Working with distributed teams is my passion.  As a remote full-stack developer and civic community builder I work with digital natives to solve problems daily.  With COVID affecting everyone we have lots of digital refugees at our door and Itâ€™s time to welcome them with open arms. As a certified Mozilla Open Leader, I can help your team get productive and engaged although they are distributed.

### Let's Connect! ðŸ’¬

If you want to connect, the best way for business is [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markdavs/), and civic projects is [Slack](http://eugenetech.slack.com).  I'm active on social media via [Instagram](http://instagram.com/markedavis) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MarkTheDavis) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nohorse). So many ways to collaborate.

### Hire me! ðŸ’»
My professional path follows a few tracks.  
- On one hand, Iâ€™m an software engineer.  Iâ€™ve been programming my whole life and a full-stack developer for over a decade. Today I focus on cloud and mobile. My strongest platform is .Net and my fav language is C#.  I'm excited about Blazor!
- On the other hand, Iâ€™m a Mozilla Open Leader and Civic Tech Evangelist.

### Have Fun! ðŸ‘‘
I also dabble in things like [hackathons](http://openeugenefest.org) and [large scale art projects](http://king-pong.com)

This page was last updated in the Spring of 2020.  Iâ€™m currently contracting thru [Dark Matter](http://darkmatter.consulting) and managing a [coworking space](http://codechops.com).  I built this page to [match](http://markdav.is) my IRL business cards.

Here's a photo of me presenting at an [AT&T developers conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=rwDRFM2hcsY&t=314) a few years ago.

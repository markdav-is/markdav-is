Welcome to my business card!  I'm glad you're here! ðŸŽ‰

I'm obsessed with collaboration.  The more folks on a project the better. We all learn from each other to bring the awesome.

If you want to connect, the best way is to chat me up in [The Slack](http://eugenetech.slack.com) or maybe use [The Switchboard](http://eugenetech.switchboardhq.com) or you scan the cred on [The LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markdavs/). I more active on 
social media via [The Instagram](http://instagram.com/markedavis) or [The Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MarkTheDavis) or [The Twitter](https://twitter.com/nohorse) or [The Tumblr](https://markdav-is.tumblr.com/). So many ways to collaborate.

My professional path follows a few tracks.  
- On one hand, Iâ€™m an software engineer.  Iâ€™ve been programming my whole life and a full-stack developer for over a decade. Today I focus on cloud and mobile.  
- On the other hand, Iâ€™m a Mozilla Open Leader and Innersource Evangelist.  

Below are links to two resumes depending on what facets of mine youâ€™d like to leverage.  I also dabble in things like [hackathons](http://openeugene.org) and [large scale art projects](http://king-pong.com)

This page was last updated in the Summer of 2019.  Iâ€™m currently on contrat with the [HP Developer Program Team](http://hp.io) and managing a [coworking space](http://codechops.com).  I put this page together to [link](http://markdav.is) for my business cards.
